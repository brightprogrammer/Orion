A hobbyist Linear Algebra library written for fun and profit.
Nothing much to show for now. At the moment, two students ([Vaibhav Pathak](https://github.com/mrdaybird) and [Me](https://github.com/brightprogrammer)) are working on this upcoming library. We're working on this from scratch in order to learn low level stuffs, optimizations and some applications of linear algebra.
